Group 6 - Simulations for Movement of Particles in a Lennard-Jones Potential Using Python and C++

1. Python code: Download and run the file "CHEM272_Project2_Master.py" as is on Spyder. This code simulates the movement of 200 particles across 10000 iterations. If these parameters have to be changed, scroll to the bottom of the code, and find the variable "M." Change the values for iterations and N, which represents the particle numbers. Incorporate these same changes for the plot_ParticleLocations function called after 'M' is defined.
