Group 6 - Simulations for Movement of Particles in a Lennard-Jones Potential Using Python and C++

Instructions for navigating through the repository:

1. Python code: Download and run the file "CHEM272_Project2_Master.py" as is on Spyder. This code simulates the movement of 200 particles across 10000 iterations. If these parameters have to be changed, scroll to the bottom of the code, and find the variable "M." Change the values for iterations and N, which represents the particle numbers. Incorporate these same changes for the plot_ParticleLocations function called after 'M' is defined.

2. C++ code: Download and run "Sutherland272Project2c++.cpp" on VS Code. The C++ code is meant to run the simulation of 200 particles over 10,000 iterations, with one particle moving per iteration.
      
3. Matplotlibcpp.h contains the parameters necessary to generate plots for the C++ code simulation. This must be downloaded in order for the plots to run.

4. To read the report, download the file titled "_Chem 272_ Project 2.pdf"
